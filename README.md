# Haskell Titan - Testing Infrastructure for Temporal AbstractioNs

Haskell Titan is a testing and debugging system for reactive, time-varying and
interactive software.

It is built on the principles of Functional Reactive Programming, although it's
ideas can be applied to other time-based abstractions.

# Collaborations

Please, send pull requests and file bugs.

If you are considering to do something similar for a different FRP
implementation, please consider adding a new backend for this project so that
we can join efforts. That way our efforts will be more likely to help you, and
yours will also help us. There's always some extra effort from trying to
collaborate with others, but it's totally worth it :)
